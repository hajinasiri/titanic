Kaggle's titanic challenge
This is the first machine learning challenge I have done. 
Some data was missing from age column that were filled by averaging the according class's age
Cabin, name, ticket and passengerId columns were droped.
sex column and Pclass columns were categorized.
Compared a few algorithms inlcluding Random Forest and logistic regression.
Logistic regression showed a better performance 
After submitting the result to Kaggle my score was 0.7606
It obviously needs more work to reach higher accuracy and will be revisited later
